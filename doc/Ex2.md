## Task 2.1: Structured computer organization: data path speed
**Question**

Consider the operation of a von Neumann machine with the data path you got to know in the lecture. Suppose that loading the ALU input registers takes 5 nsec, running the ALU takes 10 nsec, and storing the result back in the output register takes 5 nsec. What is the maximum number of MIPS this machine is capable of in the absence of pipelining?

## Task 2.2: Basics of computer systems: little‐	and big‐endian memory
**Question**
A word on a little‐endian computer with 32‐bit words has the numerical value of 3. If it is transmitted
to a big‐endian computer byte by byte and store there, with byte 0 in byte 0, and so on, what is its
numerical value on the big‐endian machine?
